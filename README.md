# LLM_Driver_Assistant

This Driver Assistant gives contextual advice and suggestions to drivers based on behavioral actions and physiological clues to determine driver's state (distracted, drowsy) as well as the context in which they happen (weather, speed according to speed limit, road type, time of the day). Dataset used is simulated based on Driver Monitoring Dataset (DMD) for behavioral actions and physiological state of the driver to cover variety of scenarios and save storage space. Angora is used for training the Assistant on Google Colab.
